Welcome to the public issues and wiki repository for Creoverse. Currently we are in the development phase, we plan to have a pre-alpha out by october 4, 2020.

## Bugs
When reporting a bug, please include the following information.
* How do you reproduce it?
* What do you expect?
* what do you get instead?


## Features
When requesting a core feature, unless its a Lua API request, please explain why this should be a core feature instead of a mod/package.

# What is our game about?
Play games, socialize, and create. Always be connected with your friends whether you are loading into a game or connected in a different server.


## Core Features 
* Avatars
* Gamemodes
* Packages (mods)
* Sandbox building
* Lua API
* Party System
* Dedicated servers
* 64-bit coordinate system
* Voxel Engine

## Core features being worked on now for Pre-Alpha Release
* Avatars
* Gamemodes
* Packages (mods)
* Lua API
* Dedicated Servers

### Avatars
Upload custom avatars.

### Gamemodes
Define the rules of your game. Killing hordes of zombies, flight simulation, Building contraptions, or playing Prop Hunt.

### Packages (mods)
A package contains functionality and/or content to expand the game with. Servers have control over what packages are loaded per game instance, the gamemode, and world.

**Packages contain**
* Gamemodes
* Lua client/shared/server
* Models/Textures/Materials/Sounds

### Lua API
Using **Lua 5.3** for now probably going to move to 5.1 for Lua JIT.

### Party System
Create a party similar to a Discoord server. When loading or not connected to any servers you are transferred to the party lounge.

### Dedicated Servers
Host your own servers running your own configuration of packages.

### 64-bit Coordinate System
Great for large-scale simulations. Space gamemodes, planetary rendering, and large scale voxel worlds.
