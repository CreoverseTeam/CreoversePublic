### Avatars
Upload custom avatars.

### Gamemodes
Define the rules of your game. killing hordes of zombies, flight simulation, Building contraptions, or playing Prop Hunt.

### Packages (mods)
A package contains functionality and/or content to expand the game with. Servers have control over what packages are loaded per game instance, the gamemode, and world.

**Packages contain**
* Gamemodes
* Lua client/shared/server
* Models/Textures/Materials/Sounds

### Lua API
Using **Lua 5.3** for now probably going to move to 5.1 for Lua JIT.

### Party System
Create a party similar to a discoord server. When loading or not connected to any servers you are transfered to the party lounge.

### Dedicated Servers
Host your own servers running your own configuration of packages.

### 64-bit Coordinate System
Great for large-scalel simulations. Space gamemodes, planetary rendering, and large scale voxel worlds.
